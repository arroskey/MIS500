66         Description: This program will go through and create two populations:
67         	1) Age 20-60 with medical events paid by Medicaid (Public option)
68         	2) Age 20-60 with medical events paid by private insurance (Private option)
69         	Then perform the analysis by showing summary statistics and t-test.
70         	
71         	All events will be collected from the seperate event files and merged into one data set.
72         	Then the number of events will be collect per person and merged with the people collected
73         	from H201(consolidated data file).
74         	
75         	Medicines will not be included as an event.
